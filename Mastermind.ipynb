    "# After this is done the user should enter their choice of four colors from the same list the computer used. \n",
    "# For instance, they may choose \"pink\", \"blue\" , \"yellow\" and \"red\" \n",
    "# After the user has made their selection, the program should display how many colors they got right in the correct position \n",
