# Python-Code
This repository displays some examples of the Python code I have written. 
Exercises come from the text book Python by Example by Nichola Lacey, Python for Everyone by Dr. Charles H. Severance, Python for Data Analyists, by Wes McKinney.
Coding samples and definitions also come from W3 schools: https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp 

It also includes note taking on Python code to help understanding the language and syntax.
